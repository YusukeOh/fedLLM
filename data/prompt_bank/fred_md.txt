The FRED-MD dataset is a monthly panel of US macroeconomic indicators published by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. This model uses 29 core series selected for their relevance to Federal Reserve communications, macroeconomic forecasting literature, and NBER business cycle indicators. The series span nine categories: real economy and production (Industrial Production, Real Personal Consumption, Capacity Utilization, Real Personal Income ex Transfers, Real Manufacturing and Trade Sales), labor market (Nonfarm Payrolls, Unemployment Rate, Average Hourly Earnings, Initial Claims, Civilian Labor Force, Average Weekly Hours in Manufacturing), prices (CPI, Core CPI, PCE Price Index, Crude Oil Prices, PCE Services Prices, PPI Finished Goods), housing (Housing Starts, Building Permits), investment and inventories (Nondefense Capital Goods Orders, Inventory-to-Sales Ratio), financial conditions (Federal Funds Rate, 10-Year Treasury Rate, Baa Corporate Bond Yield, S&P 500), exchange rates (Trade-Weighted USD), money and credit (M2, Commercial and Industrial Loans), and consumer sentiment (University of Michigan). All series are transformed to approximate stationarity following McCracken & Ng (2016).
